Over the course of my training process, I was fortunate to have outstanding mentors. I have learned from each of them a lot, and I will consider myself great in my professional and personal life if I could be even half good as them.

    <td><strong> Prof. Yafeng Yin</strong><BR> I had the honor of working with Dr. Yin during my postdoctoral position at University of Michigan. I am astonished by his knowledge and insights, and I literally learn something new during each meeting with him. I think Dr. Yin reads every paper and book in the field and remembers them by heart which enables him to refer me to the best references for any problem. In addition, he is always available for help and he is very considerate.

    <td><strong> Prof. Matthew Roorda</strong><BR> Dr. Roorda was my Ph.D. supervisor at University of Toronto. I am always thankful for all his support and guidance through one of the most challenging periods of my life. I never forget how well he responded to my dilemma regarding the leave of absence due to my father’s illness: ”Ph.D. is important but not that important!”. Besides, Matt is a great chef and cooks great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fesenj%C4%81n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Fesenjān</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahchin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Tahchin</a>.

    <td><strong> Dr. Mehdi Nourinejad</strong><BR> My friendship with Dr. Nourinjead goes back to my undergrad studies at Sharif University of Technology. Mehdi is brilliant and innovative. He is also a great friend and one who I go to first for any advice. He did a lot for me which I cannot tell them all. I think he would say that ”he saved my life once” by taking me to the hospital when I had a rupture in my spleen.
