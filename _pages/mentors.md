Throughout my professional training, I have been fortunate to work under the guidance of outstanding mentors. The lessons I've gleaned from their wisdom and expertise are invaluable, and they have indelibly shaped both my personal and professional growth. If I can emulate even a fraction of their excellence, I will consider myself successful in my endeavors.

## Prof. Yafeng Yin

I had the honor of working with Dr. Yin during my postdoctoral position at the University of Michigan. His knowledge and insights are astonishing, and I find myself learning something new in every meeting with him. I am continually impressed by Dr. Yin's extensive familiarity with the literature in our field; his ability to recall and recommend the most pertinent references for any given problem is extraordinary. In addition, his consistent availability and unwavering consideration have been invaluable to me.

## Prof. Matthew Roorda

Dr. Roorda served as my Ph.D. advisor at the University of Toronto, and I am deeply grateful for his unwavering support and guidance during one of the most challenging phases of my life. I vividly recall his compassionate response to my dilemma regarding a leave of absence due to my father's illness, when he wisely said, "The Ph.D. journey is important but not as important as family." Furthermore, Matt's culinary skills are exceptional, and he prepares delicious [Fesenjān](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fesenj%C4%81n) and [Tahchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahchin).

## Prof. Hedayat Z. Ashtiani

Dr. Aashtiani was my M.Sc. supervisor at Sharif University of Technology. My fascination with transportation engineering took root after enrolling in his Systems Engineering course as an undergraduate. Additionally, it was under Dr. Aashtiani's supervision during my master's thesis that my passion for research truly ignited.

## Dr. Mehdi Nourinejad

My friendship with Dr. Nourinejad dates back to my undergraduate studies at Sharif University of Technology. Mehdi is brilliant and innovative. He is not only a great friend but also the first person I turn to for advice. There are countless ways he has supported me that I couldn't possibly list them all. One significant instance I believe he would recall is when “he saved my life” by rushing me to the hospital after a rupture in my spleen.
